How did it go?
I think it went alright some of the aspects were confusing to me.  Images were the main thing that I spent the most time on, which was also the case last week.  My quotes are changing and my shapes are moving (hopefully there is enough of those aspects).  Those elements made more sense to me.  You chose something to update or turn on and off based off of the button click event.  I'm not sure how I feel about jQuery as it seems simple but some of the aspects I have a hard time grasping exactly how they work.




Completed Homework Steps
1. Create a page that uses jQuery. You can either have it locally or use a CDN.
4. Add text onto the screen. It can be quotes, words of wisdom, or just words.
6. You are going to have different shapes that move around the screen too. (3 shapes right now)
5. You should rotate through different words as well after a certain time. (rotate_word function)
7. These shapes should move for a specific time, and then they should fade out, and a different image(shape?) should appear.

To Do/Figure Out
2. Add images that fade in and out.
3. Rotate between different images each time an image fades out.
