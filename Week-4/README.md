Homework #4
At first this week went really well.  I have no idea what I did but some of my decisions are broken but there are no errors being reported in the console.

I thought it was fun to mess around with the variables more although I notice that these story games can get confusing especially when you try to make a bunch of different choices for the decisions.

Overall I think it was going fine until I got wayy too busy.  I'm hoping to continue updating this.
