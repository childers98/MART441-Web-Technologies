2. Create a class for your objects in the JSON file


5. Make sure the player cannot collide with any of the objects on the canvas

7. Create objects from each entry in the fileâ€¦???
8. Create a new array for each of these objects
9. Make sure when the player collides with those objects, they are collected, and the collectibles disappear (might want to look at that game we made in my other class)
10. Show an increase in the score when picking up a collectible


How'd it go?


Homework Finished
1. Create a JSON file with at least 5 objects in it
    -warm pink/purple (can't hit cause it is in the middle of the lime square)
    -light green rectangle
    -light blue square
    -light blue purple
    -light pink purple
3. Add all objects to the array - do I need to add the squares that are the main ones?
4. Create an object for your player and make sure it can move with the arrow keys - green player
6. Create another json file with at least three objects in it - collectibles.JSON
