This week went alright.  I think I understood most of the content.  The one thing that I had a problem with was getting the image to change with the new variables.  I looked around on quite a few websites but didn't find anything that actually worked within my code.  Everything overall made a lot of sense.  It was interesting to consider and find social justice pieces for this project.  I think that the hardest part of that was finding who or what the art piece was about.



Homework
1. Create a single class
2. Create at least five different objects from that class with the following properties:
    -title
    -image
    -description
    -image year (make it up if you don't know)
3. Store each object in a single Array
4. Have a button on the page
6. Pressing the button should randomly display an object from the array
