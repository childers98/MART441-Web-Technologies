For my final I really wanted to focus on games since I totally forgot that we had made a couple at the beginning of the semester.

I went around looking for different games to create in javascript and settled on 3 different ones: Snake, Tic Tac Toe, and Tetris.  I started all of my games in a google doc since I was at work at the time.  I transferred that information into Atom and most of the code would usually work.  I started by thinking of all of the pieces I would need to complete all of these games and then started gathering pieces.  For most of the games I started by building out a canvas and pieces of sorts.

I eventually switched over to some more tutorial focused things.  Especially for the tetris, although it was the worst tutorial by far.  I used more sites than listed below but I got to a point where I wanted to compare my code due to small errors that were making the games unplayable.

Tic Tac Toe is functional although I think there are some minor adjustments that need to be made.  The snake in the Snake game is unable to be controlled right now and the Tetris game I am still sorting through information to finish it.

Overall I almost think I should've just focused on another smaller scale game but it has really brought to my attention how hard some of the more complicated games are to code.
