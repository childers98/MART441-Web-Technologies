How did it go?
I think it went pretty well.  It was pretty interesting to implement the changes with the information.  It was basically a refresher of last semester.  I definitely remembered quite a bit about the querystring.

Installing node was good and experimenting was interesting.  Definitely don't think everything I tried out worked but it was nice to work through anyways

1. Install node.js.
2. Experiment with callbacks, streams and the file system to create a web application that allows you to gather and display data from the user.
3. Once the information is gathered, go to another page and display what was entered.
Note you will need to install the following module to get it to work.

Enter this command in your command prompt or terminal

npm install --save node-html-parser (Installed this)

4. When the user clicks on the submit button, the user data should be written to a text file and update the HTML file to which you navigate. The data entered should display on the second page. To display the data, you can grab the information from the QueryString. (please refer to the example â€“ it has everything you need for this part).
5. Write a short paper (1/2 page) on your experience. How does node.js fit into everything that we have done this semester?
6. Submit everything into your repository and submit your link to Moodle.
Note the main crux of this project is just writing to a text file.
