This week went pretty well I think the Codeacademy was great.  I also downloaded grasshopper to practice with when I'm away from my computer.  Learning the console.log element wasn't too bad because I had a friend who had showed it to me during previous classes.

I wasn't exactly sure how to make things display on the page using JavaScript but I did fiddle with that a little bit and looked at some other people's code.  Did not understand quite what they were trying to do with their stuff.
