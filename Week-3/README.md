This week went alright.  I must have messed some small thing up earlier on in the week because
I went to run my code this weekend and it was only running through one of the if statements.  Then nothing else.
I ended up going back to the example and working from that and it started working again.  Not sure what the difference was as
the console wasn't giving me any errors.
