6. The background should change if they collide (also make the border change color?)
8. Objects cannot leave the canvas edges - add collider
9. Embed some background music

How Did It Go?


Homework
1. You have at least two objects on your canvas - 4 total
2. Create a class for your objects - squares
3. Put a nice border around the canvas - orange
4. One object to be controlled by the user - plum square
5. One object should move autonomously (by itself) - 2 move by themselves
7. The objects should change size if they collide - all 4 change sizes but only when the first square hits the second
