How'd it go?
This week went really well.  I thought that this content was really fun to dig through and interesting.  I'm surprised at how easy it is to create a game using phaser.

I went around to a couple different websites to explore different options for level creation but didn't find anything that was more directed at what I wanted to do for guidance.  I wanted to change the level after hitting a certain number of points.

Instead of doing another obstacle that kills the player I decided to do an obstacle that subtracts points from the players score.  I was also working on trying to get my level change to work which is why I made Childers_phaser.html.  I messed around with this and got annoyed so then tried to go back and add a timer instead.  Neither of those aspects work and I think I need to tie the timer into the button press functions somehow.


Done
1. Make the character jump with the spacebar instead of the up button
7. Create different graphics to gather with different values if you get them - diamonds and blue balls
8. Add more platforms
5. Why not add some spikes to avoid? You could create a new ‘spikes’ group and check for collision vs. the player, only instead of killing the spike sprite you kill the player instead - instead of killing the player it takes away some of their points
2. Change the gravity of the stars
3. Change the gravity, so each star has gravity (I think this one is also done)


Implement at least 5 of these
4. Use different sprites for the player - look in the assets folder
6. For a non-violent game, make it a speed-run and challenge them to collect the stars as quickly as possible
9. Add a new level if they collect all the stars on the screen.  Show the current level that the player is on.
