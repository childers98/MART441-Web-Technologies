Implement at least 5 of these
2. Change the gravity of the stars
3. Change the gravity, so each star has gravity
4. Use different sprites for the player - look in the assets folder
5. Why not add some spikes to avoid? You could create a new ‘spikes’ group and check for collision vs. the player, only instead of killing the spike sprite you kill the player instead
6. For a non-violent game, make it a speed-run and challenge them to collect the stars as quickly as possible

8. Add more platforms
9. Add a new level if they collect all the stars on the screen.  Show the current level that the player is on.


Done
1. Make the character jump with the spacebar instead of the up button
