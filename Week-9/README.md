Homework - To Do
3. Display your data in a meaningful way??? - would like to do dots of the coordinates
4. Create a jQuery plugin that you can apply to your data as well - snowflake?

How Did it Go?
Oh boy I swear there was at least 20 tabs open at one time while I was trying to do this.  Getting the data set was fun and interesting to see all of the different things that had been collected.  Reading through the first line to figure out what parts the data was giving me was also interesting.

Overall I think it was alright to work with.  I spent a lot of time doing research to get a better understanding of what to do with all of the pieces.  Finding a jQuery plug in to use was also interesting.  I picked out a couple but I thought the snowflake one made the most sense as my data was referencing meteorites hitting the Earth so there was a mimicking of the falling motion.

Homework
1. Find a dataset to display - Earth Meteorite Landings
2. Use jQuery and AJAX to access the JSON file (CORS Error - fixed?)
