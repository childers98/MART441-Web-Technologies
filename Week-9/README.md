How Did it Go?
Oh boy I swear there was at least 20 tabs open at one time while I was trying to do this.  Getting the data set was fun and interesting to see all of the different things that had been collected.  Reading through the first line to figure out what parts the data was giving me was also interesting.

Overall I think it was alright to work with.  I spent a lot of time doing research to get a better understanding of what to do with all of the pieces.  I tried to plot my data in dots using the coordinates but I ended up leaving it as the fading words from the example.  I was not sure how to go about making the dot graph using only the coordinate part of the data.  Finding a jQuery plug in to use was also interesting.  I picked out a couple but I thought the snowflake one made the most sense as my data was referencing meteorites hitting the Earth so there was a mimicking of the falling motion.

At the end of it I don't think anything is working how I wanted it as I'm not sure that I totally understand how all of the different parts are supposed to go together.  Although I do feel like I understand what most of it is supposed to be doing.

Homework
1. Find a dataset to display - Earth Meteorite Landings
2. Use jQuery and AJAX to access the JSON file (CORS Error - fixed?)
3. Display your data in a meaningful way - dots of the coordinates
4. Create a jQuery plugin that you can apply to your data as well - snowflake?
