Wow I've never had so many "invisible" problems in my code.  Usually I'm given some kind of error to go off of but this has been completely going through line by line and looking for little things.

I'm realizing how not obvious some of these things are to me in JavaScript but I've never liked JavaScript.

This week I think I got everything up and running properly without any errors.  It was a lot of trial and error and staring off into space and thinking about how things were working.
