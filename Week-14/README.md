How Did it Go?
I think this week went well.  It was relatively easy.  I wanted to play around more with the text functionality but I spent a lot of my time just retyping the code so that I code see it in action and again process what was going on with it.

I think that the three.js has a lot of possibility and was interesting to look at all of the different project ideas that are out there to do and try out.
